# Emp_System
Created an employee system that manages a collection of operations with the features: list, insert, update, and delete.

I have successfully developed and implemented a robust Todo application using cutting-edge technologies such as Spring Boot, MySQL, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate.
My project involved creating a feature-rich web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently.

Leveraging Spring Boot, I rapidly set up the application, saving valuable time on configuration and focusing on building the application's core functionalities.
By utilizing MySQL as the database and integrating it seamlessly with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate, I ensured smooth and reliable data storage and retrieval.

The combination of these technologies enabled me to perform object-relational mapping with ease, translating Java objects into database entities and vice versa.

Throughout the development process, I maintained a high level of code quality and efficiency. I adopted the "update" mode for Hibernate's DDL auto, 
enabling automatic schema updates, ensuring that the database schema stayed up-to-date with the evolving application.

Furthermore, I leveraged my knowledge of Spring Web to implement RESTful APIs, enabling smooth communication between the front end and back end of the application.
This allowed users to interact with the Todo application seamlessly.

Overall, the experience of building the Todo application using Spring and the mentioned technologies has strengthened my skills in Java development, 
Spring framework, database management, and RESTful API design.
